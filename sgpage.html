            in 2017, the Yankees traded 3 promising prospect for one starting pitcher. he had finish third in the 2015 AL cy young voting, and was named to the AL All-Star team. with a potential ace up their sleeve, the Yankees had high hope of winning the world series that season. but when fall comes around, he just couldn't live up to the expectation. Sonny finishes in the Yankees with a 4.51 ERA in 41 appearances, and the Yankees never made it past the ALCS. he revealed later that they wanted him to throw a lot of slider, which he wasn't good at. that the pitch would either missed the spot and get in the zone, or put him behind the count. in his last game with the Yankees, Sonny told himself, screw it, I'll pitch the way I always pitch. he ended up throwing two scoreless inning in his relief appearance. He thought to himself that maybe they'll put him in the post-season roster, but they never did. Freshly traded to the reds in 2019, he was reunited with his old pitching coach and catcher. He finishes seventh in the AL cy young voting, and was name to the All-Star team again.
