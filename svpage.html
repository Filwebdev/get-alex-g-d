            when Stephen was just an 9 years old boy, his coach told the team to go and pick a position. like most kids, he dreamt to be a shortstop. upon seeing his teammates run everywhere but behind the plate, he decided to become a catcher instead. one of the many times he would show signs as the best captain of all time. Stephen was very much appreciated by the fans and his own teammates. his good humor and nature had led him with a great career throughout his life.

            he hit his first homerun with the A's in his major league debut as a rookie. and in the most romantic way he hit his last homerun also with the A's after 4 years spending his time away from Oakland, in his last ever at-bat with his kids announcing him at the booth. after being a bullpen coach for a year, Stephen came back as the guardians manager in 2024. making him one of the fastest player to manager since 1987.
