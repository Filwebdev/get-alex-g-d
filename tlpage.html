            to be honest I just want to add him because he looks like Alex G at some point. bearing the nickname the freak, Tim Lincecum was a pretty cartoon-ish player. with his slight physique, he doesn't really look threatening on the mound. 
            <br>
            <br>
            he was a fan favorite for being one of the best pitcher ever. he won two cy young awards and three times a world series champion. his biggest crime was being stop by a cop with a bunch of mary in his car. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Tim tried a lot to stay in the major league. he had a lot of come back moments, but with injuries, life took a lot of detour. with his wife passing 6 years after his brother, he exit quietly and never really heard again.
